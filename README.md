⊬ Hello there, I'm Bea, a passionate technology enthusiast and aspiring AI developer. 
Currently donning the intern hat at Ball Corporation, I find myself immersed in the dynamic realms of ServiceNow administration, 
specializing in IT Service Management (ITSM) and Human Resources Service Delivery (HRSD).

🖥️ My journey in the world of technology has been a thrilling ride, and I'm currently on the road to graduation with a focus on database technology. 
I harbor a profound love for computer science, and my heart beats in Python code. 
Aspiring to shape the future with artificial intelligence, I am eager to explore and contribute to the endless possibilities that lie ahead.

🚀 Beyond the confines of the corporate world, I am fueled by a curiosity that propels me to continuously learn and grow. 
As I navigate the exciting landscape of IT, databases, and coding, I am on a mission to harness the power of AI for innovative solutions that 
can positively impact the world.

🌐 Let's connect and explore the boundless horizons of technology together! 
Feel free to reach out for discussions on AI, Python, databases, or anything tech-related. 
The adventure is just beginning, and I can't wait to see where the code takes us. 🚀
